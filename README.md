When You Say Nothing At All: Brain-Computer Interface with OpenBCI

I have been colaborating with Tuan Nguyen to develop a Brain-Computer Interface application. We designed experiments from data acquisition to model deployment on Unreal Engine 4. The predictive model was built based on the architecture of ChronoNet, which is a CNN-GRU-based model. The following video demonstrated the initial robustness of the model in predicting EEG signals as control commands, followed by the movements of a drone in a simulation environment AirSim.
